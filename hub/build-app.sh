# Package beacon-hub as a signed .app bundle. macOS TCC keys Bluetooth permission to a code-signed
# app bundle (Info.plist + signature) -- a bare `swift run` binary is aborted as a privacy violation,
# even with an embedded __info_plist. Build the bundle, then run it so CoreBluetooth can PROMPT.
#
# IMPORTANT: launch via `open` (LaunchServices), NOT by running the binary path directly. macOS TCC
# only reads the bundle's Info.plist (NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription) for LaunchServices-launched
# apps; a direct `./Beacon Hub.app/Contents/MacOS/beacon-hub` is aborted as a privacy violation.
#
# Usage:  ./build-app.sh [debug|release]        # build + sign the .app
#         ./build-app.sh run [debug|release]    # build + sign + launch (logs stream to this terminal)
#         ./build-app.sh install-hooks          # merge beacon hooks + statusLine into ~/.claude/settings.json (no Swift toolchain)
